let store only objId in other model .// change of plan
backend push. update/delete it should track back and front all change of field.

req.user. check if it used productively in all case of grade.

check delete region in each stage
if region is deleted then set it to null (also in admin)
admin profile changed need to logout in all token and make region to null
in redis auto expires. admin token member stil present
EDIT field is missing in all..

while view. need signed URLimport { getSignedUrl } from "@aws-sdk/s3-request-presigner";
import { S3Client, GetObjectCommand } from "@aws-sdk/client-s3";
const client = new S3Client(clientParams);
const command = new GetObjectCommand(getObjectParams);
const url = await getSignedUrl(client, command, { expiresIn: 3600 });

-------------------
bug:
validation needed how input should be .

----------------
user - delete account
subcription course
now lets create child and add it in parent model. when create page is fetched we need to send available grade , semester in particular region. where in req.user.region have user region.
